The document outlines the requirements for a Meeting Summary AI script, which will generate summaries of meeting transcriptions in various formats (small workshops, 1:1 meetings, and large workshops). 

Key requirements include:

1. The script must be locally installed and run offline, with specific technical requirements for a Windows 11 PC with an Nvidia Card and CUDA.
2. The script should use an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) suitable for the German language.
3. The AI must be able to recognize different topics and summarize per topic, with no hallucinations.
4. The script should be able to train with the domain in the future to improve summaries.

The script will be used to summarize different types of meetings, including:

- Small workshops: teacher talks 70-80% of the time, with a summary of main topics and points covered.
- 1:1 meetings: summarize issues discussed, analysis performed, and solutions found.
- Large workshops: summarize questions asked, discussions, and teacher's recommendations, focusing on interactions between participants and the teacher.

The document also outlines the technical requirements, LLM options, and time estimation for the project.
